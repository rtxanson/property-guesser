# Property Guesser

Messing around with Elm again: `make env` and `npm run start` should be enough
to make this thing run.

This project is bootstrapped with [Create Elm
App](https://github.com/halfzebra/create-elm-app).

## Tokens

You may need to provide some api tokens. Copy `Tokens.elm.in` to `Tokens.elm`
and supply some things; do the same with `server-conf.yaml.in` and
`server-conf.yaml`.

## What is it?

Turning property records into a game, where users have to guess the correct
attribute.
